This work started in September 2014.

The parser was initially developped by Thomas Rolling (UTBM) in the frame of an internship and followed by Andr√© Schaaff and Gilles Landais.

It has been tested in various situations but if you encounter a problem or if you have suggestions concerning corrections and / or evolutions you may send a mail to cds-question@unistra.fr with the title votable.js
